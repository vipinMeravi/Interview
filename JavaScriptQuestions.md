Q. call, apply, and bind?
A. The call, apply, and bind methods are all used to manipulate the this context of a function in JavaScript. They differ in how they pass arguments to the function and when they invoke the function.

call() and apply() both invoke the function immediately, while bind() returns a new function with the specified this context bound, which can be called later.

call() and apply() differ in how they pass arguments. call() accepts arguments individually, while apply() accepts arguments as an array.

bind() does not immediately invoke the function; instead, it returns a new function with the this value bound to the provided object, allowing you to call the function later with the specified context.

Overall, call() and apply() are used for immediate invocation with a specified context, while bind() is used to create a new function with a permanently bound this context, which can be invoked later.
<!-- Call -->
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! I'm ${this.role}.`;
}

const person = { role: 'developer' };

const message = greet.call(person, 'John');
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John! I'm developer.

<!-- Apply -->
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! I'm ${this.role}.`;
}

const person = { role: 'developer' };

const args = ['John'];
const message = greet.apply(person, args);
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John! I'm developer.

<!-- Bind -->
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! I'm ${this.role}.`;
}

const person = { role: 'developer' };

const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);
const message = greetPerson('John');
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John! I'm developer.

Certainly! Here's a list of topics that are commonly asked about in JavaScript interviews:

Q. Closures
A. Closures are a fundamental concept in javascript, and they occurs when an inner function has access to the variables and parameters of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state(the lexical environment).

Q. Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance
A. JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based     language, which means that inheritance and the reuse of  properties and methods are handled through prototypes.
 Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] (often accessed via __proto__ or through Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)). This property points to another object, known as the prototype. The prototype object itself can have a prototype, and this chain continues until it reaches an object with null as its prototype, known as the end of the prototype chain.

Q. Arrow Functions
A. Arrow functions, introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They offer a concise way to write functions and have some unique features compared to regular functions, particularly in terms of their handling of the this keyword.
 Differences from Regular Functions: 
 1. "this" Context: Arrow functions do not have their own this context.
 2. Cannot be used as Constructors: error if used with the "new" keyword. Error: Foo is not a constructor.
 3. No "arguments" Object:


Q. Promises and Async/Await
A. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises provide a cleaner, more robust way of dealing with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback-based approaches.
 A promise is created using the "Promise" constructor, which takes a function (executor) with two parameters: "resolve" and "reject".
 Promises have "then", "catch", and "finally" methods for handling the results.

 Async/Await
 Async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises. It provides a more readable and straightforward way to write asynchronous code, making it look synchronous.

 Using Async/Await
 1. Define an Async Function:
 An async function is declared with the async keyword. Inside an async function, you can use the await keyword to wait for a promise to resolve.
 2. Await a Promise:
 The await keyword pauses the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved or rejected. It can only be used inside async functions.

 "Syntactic sugar" refers to syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express, without adding new functionality to the language itself. Essentially, it means providing a more convenient and human-readable way to write code that could be written in a more verbose or complex manner using existing language features.


Q. Event Loop
A. 


Q. Scope and Hoisting
A. Scope refers to the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of your code. JavaScript has two types of scope: global and local.

 Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code execution. This applies to both variable and function declarations.
 => Variable Hoisting
 Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope but are initialized with undefined. Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but not initialized.
 => Function Hoisting
 Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, so they can be called before they are declared. Function expressions are not hoisted.


Q. Modules (import/export)
A. In JavaScript, modules allow you to break your code into separate files, each with its own scope. This promotes better organization, maintainability, and reusability of code. Modules are used to encapsulate code and to manage dependencies between different parts of an application. JavaScript supports two types of modules: CommonJS (used in Node.js) and ES6 modules (also known as ECMAScript modules or ES modules).
 => ES6 modules are the standard way of implementing modules in JavaScript. They use the "import" and "export" keywords to share code between files.
 => CommonJS is the module system used in Node.js. It uses "require" to import modules and "module.exports" or "exports" to export them.

Differences Between ES6 Modules and CommonJS
1. Syntax:
 = ES6 modules use import and export.
 = CommonJS uses require and module.exports.
2. Load Time:
 = ES6 modules are statically analyzed and imported at load time.
 = CommonJS modules are loaded synchronously at runtime.
3. Scope:
 = ES6 modules are always in strict mode and have their own scope.
 = CommonJS modules can use both strict and non-strict mode.
4. Support:
 = ES6 modules are supported natively in browsers and Node.js.
 = CommonJS is primarily used in Node.js.

Q. ES6 Features (let, const, destructuring, spread/rest operators)
A. Differences Between var, let, and const
  var: Function-scoped, hoisted, can be re-declared and updated.
  let: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized, cannot be re-declared in the same scope, can be updated.
  const: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized, cannot be re-declared or updated.

  => Destructuring: Unpacks values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
   Array destructuring: [first, second] = array
   Object destructuring: { key1, key2 } = object
  => Spread Operator (...): Expands an iterable (array/object) into individual elements.
    Arrays: [...array]
    Objects: {...object}
  => Rest Operator (...): Collects all remaining elements/properties into an array or object.
   Function parameters: function(...args) {}
   Destructuring: const [first, ...rest] = array or const { key, ...rest } = object

  
Q. Callback Functions
A. A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming, such as handling events, performing I/O operations, or making network requests.
 => Callback Hell and Pyramid of Doom
  When multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other, it can lead to deeply nested callbacks, known as "callback hell" or the "pyramid of doom."

Q. Higher-Order Functions
A. A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
 Takes one or more functions as arguments.
 Returns a function as its result.
 Many built-in JavaScript functions use higher-order functions by accepting functions as arguments. Some common examples include Array.prototype.map, Array.prototype.filter, and Array.prototype.reduce.

Q. "this" keyword
A. The value of this depends on the context in which a function is called.
In the global context, this refers to the global object.
In a method, this refers to the object the method belongs to.
In a constructor, this refers to the newly created object.
Arrow functions inherit this from their surrounding context.
call, apply, and bind can explicitly set the value of this.
In event handlers, this refers to the element that received the event.
In ES6 classes, this behaves similarly to constructor functions.
